# Predicting brain activity from word embeddings during natural language comprehension

This tutorial introduces a typical **enc**oding framework for mapping **ling**uistic embeddings onto human brain activity during natural language comprehension. The tutorial includes worked examples for both fMRI and ECoG datasets collected while subjects listened to naturalistic spoken narratives. Two types of word embeddings are obtained based on the stimulus transcripts: static word embeddings from word2vec and contextual word embeddings from GPT-2. Encoding models are estimated using banded ridge regressionâ€”this allows us to predict brain activity from word embeddings for left-out segments of data.
